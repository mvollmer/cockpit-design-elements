### Elements of Cockpit Design

That's a grand title for what is currently just a collection of random
notes about some guiding principles for Cockpit design.  They go from
the very high level and abstract to concrete decisions about which
Patternfly components to use and how.

The idea is that these principles will help answer design related
questions during feature development.  If you don't know what to do,
go and have a look here.  If you don't find an answer here and have to
do some hard thinking and research to come up with it, add it to this
document.

The document is [here](elements.md).
